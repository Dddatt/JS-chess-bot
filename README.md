<b>A fully pure JS chess bot. Basic html used for UI. No WASM, no opening book, no threading, no porting, blah blah blah. I've never seen one with the same strength and guidelines.</b>

The main framework is based upon bluefeversoftware's simplier chess bot(best i could find that fits the guidelines above) which I added more things and optimized much more and now is faster and plays better. Also for some reason the site is down-


The original bluefeversoftware chess bot had an opening book, this one does not. Before the site went down, I made both play a game, both given 1s, and mine(white) won. Tho that's not saying much as the game was pretty chaotic according to SF:
